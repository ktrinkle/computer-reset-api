          <p>We are a group of volunteers helping the daughter of Richard Byron, owner of 
            Computer Reset, liquidate the Dallas legendary computer resale shop.
          </p>
          <p>Located within the walls of Computer Reset are a large collection of IBM
            PC Convertible parts, IBM PCJr computers and accessories, and numerous IBM and
            clone computers spanning 30+ years. Other items that have been sold include
            the famous Dune Buggy, cars, audio/visual equipment, a fire hydrant, a boat motor,
            and all sorts of technology-related items.
          </p>
          <p>Liquidation events are held when announced, as permitted by weather and volunteer
            availability. Event signups are offered for a specific date and time slot, and are
            only available in limited numbers to comply with social distancing and governmental
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>All proceeds of the sales benefit the Byron family estate.
          </p>
